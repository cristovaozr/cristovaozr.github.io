title: New blog, new life

Ahhh! New space for a blog. Actually `github.io` has been around for a while but I never payed enough attention. I'm migrating my old blog from WordPress to here. Since I am brazillian some posts will be done in portuguese and some in english.

Most of my posts are, until now, in portuguese. This is due to the fact that exists little portuguese language posts of the type of content I like to work with. So this blog exists, mostly, to provide content about embedded systems **in portuguese**. Another reason for the existence of this blog is that it provides me a space to share what I do with the world and to serve as portifolio of my personal projects.

## Why did I quit WordPress?

Quitting WordPress was an easy choice. Not that it's a bad plataform -- on the contrary: it's very straightforward compared to this kind of blog which is hosted on `GitHub`, uses the `Jekyll` engine, uses `Markdown` and needs some knowledge of HTML for customization of the theme chosen.

These are the main reasons:

### I'm trying to reduce the number of accounts in the web

Due to the amount of services we have online it's very common to have many accounts around. This can be reduced by linking another account (for example: linking your Google Account). This can lead to having lots and lots of services around. E.g.: I used to have an account on Gitlab and Bitbucket along with my account on GitHub.

### I'm trying to reduce the amount of exposure in the web

No. You won't find me on Facebook. Yes -- I used to have an account there but it's been three years and I don't miss a bit of the social network.

### My blog is abount development hobbies -- WordPress is not well suited for that

I can blog here in Markdown -- adding snipets of code is as easy as pie. WordPress also has Markdown but it is not as straightforward as it is here.

### Conclusion

Hope to see you all around!
